# LiquidXTest
 
This was a 4hr project (test) I completed for LiquidX as part of the job application process.
I had to implement two gameplay features with C++. I chose a jetpack and interactable cubes you can pickup and throw. 
It is one of the first times I've used C++ in Unreal, I'm more familiar with Blueprints.
